I am a fourth-year condensed matter theory PhD student at UC Berkeley, working with [Sinéad Griffin](https://sineadgriffin.com) at LBL. I am primarily interested in harnessing the interplay between topology and phonons in quantum materials for quantum sensing. I am generally method-agnostic, but I often use *ab initio* approaches such as density functional theory and GW calculations to study a variety of topological systems and their electronic and phononic properties. Recently, I have been studying higher-order topological insulators, and strain- and phonon-driven topological phase transitions, for applications in dark matter detection.

Prior to joining the physics PhD program, I spent 2 years as a Berkeley Graduate Fellow and earned my MS in applied physics from the [AS&T program](http://ast.berkeley.edu) in 2019. I earned my BS from Texas A&M University in 2017, where I worked on classical integrable systems, particularly nonlinear Schödinger equations. 

I keep a website for my notes, academic and otherwise, which can be accessed [here](https://ashour.dev).

On a personal level, my hobbies include building mechanical keyboards, reading, and computer RPGs. I live with my wife, dog, and two cats in the SF Bay Area.
