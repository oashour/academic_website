I am a fifth-year physics PhD student at UC Berkeley, working with [Sinéad Griffin](https://sineadgriffin.com) at LBL. My research lies at the interface between condensed matter theory and quantum sensing. I am primarily interested in harnessing the interplay between collective excitations, such as phonons and magnons, and topological order in quantum materials, and I often use the burgeoning field of light dark matter detection as a testbed for my ideas.

I am generally method-agnostic, but my work often employs *ab initio* and analytical approaches such as density functional (perturbation) theory, many-body perturbation theory, and tight-binding models to study a variety of quantum materials and their electronic, magnetic, and phononic properties. Recently, I have been studying phonons in higher-order topological insulators and mirror Chern insulators, magnons in antiferromagnetic topological insulators, and modeling the spin ice state in pyrochlores from first principles.

I completed my BS at Texas A&M University in 2017, and then spent two years as a Berkeley Graduate Fellow, earning my MS in applied physics from the [AS&T program](http://ast.berkeley.edu) in 2019. My research during that period heavily focused on the classical integrability of the nonlinear Schrödinger hierarchy.

I maintain a [separate website](https://ashour.dev) for my notes on various academic and non-academic topics. On a personal level, my hobbies include building mechanical keyboards, reading, and breaking computer RPGs by being too optimal. I live with my wife, dog, and two cats in the SF Bay Area.
