I am a rising third-year condensed matter theory student at UC Berkeley, working with [Sinéad Griffin](https://sineadgriffin.com). My research interests include *ab initio* studies of topological systems. I am currently particularly interested in both time-reversal symmetric (TRS-TI) and antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AFTI), as well as topological sensors for dark matter detection. I have previously worked with [Steven G. Louie](https://louie.Berkeley.edu) on first-principles studies of TRS-TIs. 

Prior to joining the physics PhD program, I spent 2 years as a Berkeley Graduate Fellow exploring my interests in mathematical physics and both condensed matter theory and experiment, culminating in an MS in applied physics from the [AS&T program](http://ast.berkeley.edu).

I earned my BS in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University in 2017, with an emphasis in optics and a [thesis](https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/188543) in mathematical physics. At A&M, I studied integrable systems with professors [Siu A. Chin](https://physics.tamu.edu/directory/siu-chin/) and [Milivoj R. Belić](https://physics.tamu.edu/directory/milivoj-belic/), exploring the mathematical physics of the nonlinear Schrödinger hierarchy. I additionally pursued experimental and computational work at the [Rentzepis](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/profiles/rentzepis-peter.html) lab in ultrafast x-ray diffraction and biophysics.

I am the developer of a Julia package for sovling nonlinear Schrodinger equations, known as [NonlinearSchrodinger.jl](https://github.com/oashour/NonlinearSchrodinger.jl).

On a personal level, my hobbies include building mechanical keyboards, 3D printing and home automation. I live with my wife and [two cats](cats) in the SF Bay Area. 

I keep a website for my notes, academic and otherwise, which can be accessed [here](https://ashour.dev).
