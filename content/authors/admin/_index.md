I am a second year condensed matter theory student at UC Berkeley, working with [Steven G. Louie][Louie]. My research interests include *ab initio* studies, particularly GW-BSE calculations, of various material systems. I am especially interested in topological systems and optical properties of TMDCs. Prior to joining the physics PhD program, I spent 2 years as a Berkeley Graduate Fellow exploring my interests in mathematical physics and both condensed matter theory and experiment, culminating in an MS in applied physics from the [AS&T][AST] program.

I earned my BS in electrical engineering from [Texas A&M University][TAMU] in 2017, with an emphasis in optics and a thesis in mathematical physics. At A&M, I studied integrable systems with professors [Siu Chin][Chin] and [Milivoj Belic][Belic], exploring periodic solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger hierarchy. I additionally pursued experimental and computational work at the [Rentzepis lab][Rentzepis] in ultrafast x-ray diffraction.

Some of my publications are listed below, but for an up-to-date list, please check my [google scholar][scholar] profile.

On a personal level, my hobbies include building mechanical keyboards, 3D printing and home automation. I live with my girlfriend and 2 [cats][cats] in the SF Bay Area.
