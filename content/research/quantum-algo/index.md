#This burgeoning realm of quantum sensing exploits exotic phenomena in quantum materials, such as topological order, strong correlations, and magnetic spin textures as new pathways to low-threshold sensors. Such sensors go beyond next-generation dark matter detectors, with applications in quantum information science and future quantum technologies.


#I am interested in harnessing the interplay between topological order and collective excitations, primarily phonons and magnons, to develop new quantum sensing schemes. Such excitations can break symmetries that protect the gapless boundary states in topological insulators, thus leading to a metal-insulator transition at the boundary, which could then be detected. My work employs various analytical and computational tools, such as density functional (perturbation) theory, many-body perturbation theory, and tight binding models, to elucidate the electronic, magnetic, and excited-state properties of various quantum materials. Additionally, I often utilize models from high-energy physics to study dark matter interaction with such materials.

As a PhD summer intern with the quantum computing group at NERSC, I developed quantum algorithms for applications in quantum chemistry and quantum dynamics.

## Projects

* Studying the formation of topological defects across quantum phase transitions using neutral atom quantum computers (collaboration with QuEra).

* Developing a variant of the variatonal quantum eigensolver using only one-body reduced density matrices, and applying it to strongly correlated molecules.
